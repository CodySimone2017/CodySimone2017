<h1>Cody Simone 2017</h1>
<aside>Not Even On the Ballot</aside>
</header>
<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>Cody and Simone's bid for SGA president started out when they were annoyed at how many signs there were springing up all over campus like 
  weeds. Like really, thats at least $400 worth of signs. I made these myself on the cheap.</p>  
  
<p>I think we've know each other for like, six months? Oh and we choose our slogan because we aren't on the ballot and want to toss in a
  reality check to the whole affair.</p>
  
<h2>The Issues</h2>
<p>It isn't like SGA platforms are even controversial. <i>We want more bus hours, better services, a sauna in the gym, less tuition.</i> 
Yea, real hard hitting issues, very divisive. But budgets exist and it's not like SGA is the Florida Senate or the Board of Trustees. I say
we focus on two things which we can actually accomplish.</p>

<ul>
<li>Advocate for a more sensible UCF budget.
<li>Build a sense of community on campus.
</ul>
  
<h2>Our REAL Issues</h2>
<p>Ok why not, I can't resist. Here's what I would do as a last-minute write-in candidate whos more liberal than half of you would like, but half
  again as liberal as half of you fear. We're also banking on that strong atheist-Catholic demographic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Expedite the approval process for building new sorority houses via total deregulation of the process
<li>Conversely, we could speed up the approval process for those that already have funding via a reasonable process
<li>Make the library run 24 hours
<li>Have every student on campus get a free copy of Wolfram Mathematica
<li>Keep Aramak from forming some sort of evil monopoly on food or something?
<li>Quadruple the CRT budget and lower taxes
<li>Add a sauna to every UCF building
<li>Drastically improve the deplorable lack of weight-traning equipment
</ul>
<h2>So get out there and vote now!</h2>
<p>I presume they will actually <a href="https://ucfsga.com/elections/elections-timeline/">post instructions</a> when the time gets closer.<p>
  
  <p style="color:purple;">There are 5 signs in total, can you collect them all?</p>
